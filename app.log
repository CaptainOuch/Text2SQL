2023-06-21 19:43:38,211 INFO Query explanation: To determine the number of active agency customers on January 1st, 2022, we need to query the "analytics" table. The query should include the following conditions:

1. Filter the rows based on the date column to include only the data for January 1st, 2022.
2. Filter the rows based on the platform column to include only the data for agency customers. The platform values for agency customers might include "Google", "LinkedIn", "Facebook", and "Bing".

The query should count the distinct customers_count values for the filtered rows to determine the number of active agency customers on January 1st, 2022.
